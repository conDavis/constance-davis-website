        <p>
          I'm a software developer pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at
          Northeastern University. I have an interest in FullStack Development
          and I practice design in both Front-End and Back-End Development. I
          enjoy exploring design patterns and principles, in code, and in
          self-expression.

        <AboutMeHeading>How I work: Motivation and Care</AboutMeHeading>
        <p>
          Whenever Iâ€™m making something, I remind myself of my motivation for
          doing so, as well as reminding myself to be mindful and act with
          forethought.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Motivation</b>
          <br />
          What problem or need am I addressing?
          <br />
          What do I want the end user to experience?
          <br />
          What led me to this project in the first place?
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Care</b>
          <br />
          As I move through the process of design and implementation, I try to
          do justice to this motivation through care, through working with
          intention, honesty, effort and curiosity.
